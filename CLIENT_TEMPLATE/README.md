# CLIENT_TEMPLATE

This is the reusable client scaffold for Project Second Brain IDE.AI. Duplicate this folder and rename it to the client name to start a new client workspace.

- Fill `_context/context.md` and `_context/repo_links.md`
- In `sow_projects/project_1`, complete `charter.md`, `understanding.md`, `approach.md`
- Add Jira filter and board link to `tickets/index.md`
- Use `templates/` to create new documents
